## Project Name:  
HoloPop  

## Project Description:  
Our project is to develop a Unity based game that is compatible with Microsoft's HoloLens. Our game will scan and recognize certain items in the room and "pop" during specified times. This project will be used to incentivize individuals to perform certain tasks, such as taking surveys. A corresponding surveying app will be created on Xamarin. As the user completes more activities commonly seen as unpleasant, he or she will unlock more capabilities in the Unity game.

## Vision Statement:  
Our vision is to supply our users with a fun short gaming experience utilizing each user's immediate enviroment. We will also help companies seeking survey info by creating an incentive system for individuals to participate.

## Project Motivation:  
The motivation behind our project is for team members to learn the Unity engine, to practice the supporting programming languages, to gain experience with augmented reality using Microsoft's HoloLens, to gain basic database experience by looking up users and their survey completion, and to gain experience creating a Xamarin app.

## Project Risks:  
Little to no experience with Unity for some team members
Difficult to organize meetings -- scheduling conflicts
Possibly difficult to find appropriate components on Unity  
Documentation for HoloLens is occasionally buggy
HoloLens adds another layer of difficulty for debugging
Access to all the software, includes Microsoft 10 Pro  
No experience in Xamarin
No experience in databases
Xamarin and Unity don't play nicely together. 

## Risk Mitigation:  
Downloading all software as soon as possible and practicing required languages  
Frequently communicating via free communication apps  
Using Unity help forums to ask questions
Doing the Unity, HoloLens, and Xamarin tutorials
Using shared access to a database to work around compatibility issues with Xamarin and Unity
Teaching each other about Unity and HoloLens from our own experiences
