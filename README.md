## Project Name:  
HoloPop  

## Project Description:  
Our project is to develop a Unity based game that is compatible with Microsoft's HoloLens. Our game will scan and recognize certain physical objects in the room and "pop" up virtual objects associated with those physical objects. In addition, there will be mini-games to play placed around the room. This project will be used to incentivize individuals to perform certain tasks, such as taking surveys. A corresponding surveying app will be created on Xamarin. As the user completes more activities commonly seen as unpleasant, he or she will unlock more capabilities in the Unity game.

## Vision Statement:  
Our vision is to supply our users with a fun short gaming experience utilizing each user's immediate enviroment. We will also help companies seeking survey info by creating an incentive system for individuals to participate.

## Project Motivation:  
The motivation behind our project is for team members to learn the Unity engine, to practice the supporting programming languages, to gain experience with augmented reality using Microsoft's HoloLens, to gain basic database experience by looking up users and their survey completion, and to gain experience creating a Xamarin app.

## Project Risks:  
Little to no experience with Unity for some team members
Difficult to organize meetings -- scheduling conflicts
Possibly difficult to find appropriate components on Unity  
Documentation for HoloLens is occasionally buggy
HoloLens adds another layer of difficulty for debugging
Access to all the software, includes Microsoft 10 Pro  
No experience in Xamarin
No experience in databases
Xamarin and Unity don't play nicely together. 

## Risk Mitigation:  
Downloading all software as soon as possible and practicing required languages  
Frequently communicating via free communication apps  
Using Unity help forums to ask questions
Doing the Unity, HoloLens, and Xamarin tutorials
Using shared access to a database to work around compatibility issues with Xamarin and Unity
Teaching each other about Unity and HoloLens from our own experiences


## User Stories (6 Required):  
* 001: “As a gamer, I want to see my favorite game characters and objects in my room so that I can bring my favorite games to life”  
* 002: “As a busy employee who loves to multitask, I want extra virtual browsers to pop up when I look at my laptop"  
* 003: “As a parent, I want my child to see a virtual teddy bear whenever she looks at her bed”  
* 004: “As a security conscious user of this product, I'm ok with companies seeing my demographic information, but I want personal information like my name to be hidden”  
* 005: “As a test engineer, I want to test my team's new app ideas on young people so that I can see if they like them and may use them”  
* 006: “As a marketing specialist, I want to learn peoples' opinions on some of my catch phrase ideas so that I can see which one resonates the most with our target audience”  

## Methodology:
We will be using an agile development methodology by creating the necessary components in 2-3 week sprints and compiling the components on the Hololens.
