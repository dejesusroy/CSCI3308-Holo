# CSCI3308-HoloPollster

HoloPollster is Windows Phone app that enables marketers and developers to create, launch and monitor incentivized surveys. Each time an individual takes a survey, they unlock a new feature or level in one of four unity games.  

## Repo  
This repo has 3 main components.   
* The required submission documents are saved individually in the main directory.  
* 4 Unity games (3D Pong, CU_Themed_Pool, Snake3D and Roll-a-ball) are in indivudal folders in the main directory.  
* The HoloPollster Windows Phone app is in a folder in the main directory.  

## Build/Run/Test  
* To launch a Unity game, download the folder containing the game (or clone the repo) and open the game's .exe file.  Either method is fine as long as the user has both the executable and the respective data folder. Without the latter, the .exe will not run.
* To launch the HoloPollster Windows Phone app, dowlond the HoloPollster folder (or clone the repo.) Open the HoloPollster.sln file in Visual Studios. Build the solution. Run the solution in a Windows Phone 8.1 emulator.
